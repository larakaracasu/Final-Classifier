# Final-Classifier

This is a joint project by 2021 Hindsight Technology Solutions data science & machine learning interns:
  - Annita Chang
  - Meileen Jones
  - Lara Karacasu
  - Sukanya Krishna.

The final product is a finetuned classifier for news articles. It tags the articles, which are web scraped from CBS News using Python's Beautiful Soup library,
with one of several tags (ie. Sports, Health, etc.) and its corresponding likelihood of belonging to its tag. The GUI takes the form of a table with basic fields
(ie. name of article, author, etc.), tag, and likelihood. Future endeavors, if provided more time, include creating a dashboard using RShiny as a convenient
visualizer for the data.
