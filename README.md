# News Article Classifier

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a finely-tuned classifier for news articles. We utilized Python's Beautiful Soup library to scrape articles from CBS News. The articles were then tagged with one of several predefined categories (e.g., Sports, Health) and assigned a corresponding likelihood of belonging to that category.

The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) in the form of a table. The table displays essential fields such as the article's name, author, and more. Additionally, each article is associated with a tag and its likelihood of belonging to that specific category.
